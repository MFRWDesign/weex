   - Support for MACOS type remote server.
   - Bugfix for reporting the wrong number of sent/delected files
     in log file.

     when remove a directory.
   - The way of check of DestDir is changed.

   - A new parameter `ChdirAtConnection' has been added. It
     controls the above.

     following before using.

       % rm ~/.weex/weex.cache.*

   - Support for configuration of files/directories (except `SrcDir'
     and `DestDir') as relative path.
