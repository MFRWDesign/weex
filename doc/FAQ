* FAQ

Q.1 The progress information that is displayed when weex sends a file
    is incorrect.
    It displays about 50KB just after starting to send. In addition,
    even if it runs up to 100%, it doesn't finish sending soon.

A.1 I guess that Linux kernel has a buffer. The other FTP clients
    has the same problem. If you know a way of avoiding it, please
    tell me it.


Q.2 Weex fails in changing a remote diretory. It outputs as the following.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
% weex foo
Connect    : www.foo.com
Entering   : public_html/
Entering   :     public_html/foo/
Cannot change remote current working directory to `public_html/foo/'.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A.2 You must specify SrcDir and DestDir in the configuration
    file as the absolute path.
    However you can specify other files/directories configurations
    as the relative path.


Q.3 Weex outputs `Cannot get remote directory list.' and stops.

A.3 The FTP server may not support passive mode. If error returns when
    connect it by a traditional FTP command and input `passive', it is so.
    Set `FtpPassive' to `false' in `weexrc' to avoid this problem.
    (It may make transfer slower)
    Now I know `cindy.on FTP server (Version: 7.2)' and 
    `Netscape SuiteSpot(tm)-Aware FTP Server - Version 1.2 (build 6)'
    are such a kind of server.
