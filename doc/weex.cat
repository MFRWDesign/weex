DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       wweeeexx  is  a  utility  designed  to  automate  the  task of
       remotely maintaining a web page or other FTP archive. With
       wweeeexx  ,  the maintainer of a web site or archive that must
       be administered through FTP interaction can largely ignore
       that  process.  The archive administrator simply creates a
       local directory that serves as an exact model for the off-
       site  data.  All  modifications  and direct interaction is
       done locally to this directory structure. When the  admin-
       istrator  wishes to coordinate the data on the remote site
       with that of the local model directory,  simply  executing
       wweeeexx  accomplishes  this  in  the most bandwidth-efficient
       fashion by only transferring files that need updating. The
       program  will create or remove (!) files or directories as
       necessary to accurately establish the local model  on  the
       remote server.

       The  mandatory  _H_O_S_T_I_D  argument  is the user-defined name
       that represents a particular FTP account or  configuration
       specified  in  the _~_/_._w_e_e_x_r_c file. This file, the contents
       of which are described below, can alternatively  be  named
       _~_/_._w_e_e_x_/_w_e_e_x_r_c.   Multiple  _H_O_S_T_I_D  arguments  to a single
       wweeeexx command are supported to affect multiple archives  or
       configurations  in  immediate succession. In addition, the
       actual _H_O_S_T_I_D can be substituted with  the  number  repre-
       senting  its relative sequential position in the _~_/_._w_e_e_x_r_c
       file (the first _H_O_S_T_I_D definition is 1, and so on).

       Because this program is meant  to  be  non-interactive,  a
       properly  set  up  configuration  file is essential.  wweeeexx
       looks for this file either in _~_/_._w_e_e_x_r_c or _~_/_._w_e_e_x_/_w_e_e_x_r_c.

       The  general  format of the configuration file is a brack-
       eted section heading followed by  parameters  that  define
       that section's configuration. This section name is what is
       provided to wweeeexx at run time to indicate the FTP  arrange-
       ment you wish to update. A parameter is only valid for the
       most recent section heading that preceded it.  The  excep-
       tion  to  this is the _[_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_] section which creates set-
       tings for unspecified parameters in every section. In  the
       case  of  parameters  that  accept  multiple  values,  the
       default section augments any specifically designated  val-
       ues.

       Lines that begin with the '#' character are safely ignored
       as  comments.   Neither  section   names   nor   parameter

       variables are case sensitive in any way. Section names can
       not begin with numbers. Some parameters  can  be  assigned
       multiple  values.  Where  this  is  not possible, the last
       value is used. To quote  special  characters,  use  single
       quotes  (')  or  double  quotes ("). To quote a particular
       quote symbol, use the other quote. The general syntax for-
       mat for the configuration file is:

       [hostid1]
               Parameter1 = Value
               # First method for multiple values
               Parameter2 = Value
               Parameter2 = Value
               ...

       [hostid2]
               Parameter1 = Value
               # Second method for multiple values
               Parameter2 = {
                      Value
                      Value
               }
               ...

       [default]
               Parameter = Value
               ...


       PPAARRAAMMEETTEERR LLIISSTT

       These  parameters  are  used to define the properties of a
       particular host  configuration  named  in  brackets.  When
       specifying  directory names, the trailing "/" is optional.
       Also, both files and directories (except SrcDir and  Dest-
       Dir) can be specified with shell wildcards.  When specify-
       ing files, if a file or file pattern is  given  without  a
       path,  it  is  assumed to be available when encountered in
       any directory.  If it is an explicitly specified path/file
       combination, the configuration is available in that direc-
       tory.  Files/directories except `SrcDir' and `DestDir' can
       be  specified as both absolute path and relative path. But
       you must specify `SrcDir' and `DestDir' as absolute  path.
       When  you  want to specify `/public_html/ignoreme.html' as
       relative path, you should specify `./ignoreme.html' rather
       than  `ignoreme.html'.  When specifying binary states, you
       may use any of the  following:  True/False,  Yes/No,  T/F,
       1/0. None are case sensitive.

              Filename  patterns  that  will be transferred using

              ries specified with ChangePermissionDir are changed
              to  this  parameter.  The  format  is a three digit
              octal number.

              Files in directories  assigned  to  this  parameter
              will  have  their  access permissions changed after
              sending.  Specify local directories.

              Set `true' to change remote current working  direc-
              tory  to  DestDir at connection.  If remote current
              working directory at connection  is  DestDir,  weex
              runs  faster  a  bit  by  setting this parameter to
              `false'.  Default is `true'.


       CCoonnvvTTooLLoowweerr
              If set to `true', the filenames  are  converted  to
              lower  case  before  sending.   This feature allows
              interaction with FTP servers that  do  not  support
              case  sensitive  filenames.  If  a  naming conflict
              arises due to a lower case name  already  existing,
              an  error occurs. Furthermore, the cache is totally
              unaware of original uppercase filenames.

              Destination directory  on  the  remote  FTP  server
              where  the  mirrored information will be sent. This
              setting corresponds to the "pwd" command on  tradi-
              tional FTP clients.

       FFoolllloowwSSyymmlliinnkkss
              Set `true' to follow symbolic  links.   Default  is

              whose size is 0 byte at default.

              have  subdirectories that are part of a project but
              don't need to  be  in  the  final,  online  version

              want to have other material on the remote FTP  site
              that  is  not  related to the specific project that
              wweeeexx is dealing with. This could include, for exam-

              disconnection  message.  If 1 or less, records each
              connection.  If 2, records each directory.  If 3 or

       $$ wweeeexx NNiinnjjaa

       would  cause the file system assigned to SSrrccDDiirr to be com-
       pletely mirrored on the remote server.  Executing:

       $$ wweeeexx nniinnjjaa vveeggggiiee

       would cause the FTP update to occur for the  "Ninja"  con-
       figuration  and  then for the "Veggie" configuration. This
       could also be specified like this:

       $$ wweeeexx 11 22

       wweeeexx implements a cache of file timestamps from Ver 1.6.0.
       This  makes  updating  much  faster when you have a lot of
       files.  In addition, wweeeexx also caches directory  structure
       and  file  names  from  Ver 2.5.0.  So never slow transfer
       even if you have many directories and files.  If, however,
       you  change  the  remote  files with another FTP client or
       running wweeeexx is killed or wweeeexx is terminated by an  error,
       the  cache  file will not be correct.  The simple solution
       to this problem is to remove the cache  file  (located  in
       _~_/_._w_e_e_x_/_w_e_e_x_._c_a_c_h_e_._H_O_S_T_N_A_M_E  )  completely  or to run wweeeexx
       with option _-_-_r_e_b_u_i_l_d_-_c_a_c_h_e.
